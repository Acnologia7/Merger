async def setup_scheduler(loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop):
    """
    Sets up and initializes the background scheduler for periodic tasks.

    This function creates an `AsyncIOScheduler` that runs on the provided event loop and
    schedules the `fetch_and_merge` method of the `DataService` to be executed periodically.
    The job is configured to run at intervals defined by the `FETCH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` setting.

    The function also establishes a database session and initializes the `DataService` with
    the session and settings. If any exceptions are encountered during setup, they are raised
    after attempting to close the session.

    Args:
        loop (asyncio.AbstractEventLoop): The event loop on which the scheduler will run.

    Returns:
        AsyncIOScheduler: The initialized scheduler with the added job.

    Raises:
        Exception: If an error occurs during the setup or job scheduling process.
